# Forc Reference

Forc stands for Fuel Orchestrator. Forc provides a variety of tools and commands for developers working with the Fuel ecosystem, such as scaffolding a new project, formatting, running scripts, deploying contracts, testing contracts, and more. If you're coming from a Rust background, forc is similar to [cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/).

If you are new to Fuel and Sway, our domain-specific language (DSL) for the [Fuel Virtual Machine](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs), see the [Sway book](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/master/book/index.html) first.

If you are new to Forc, see the [Forc Project](https://fuellabs.github.io/sway/master/book/introduction/forc_project.html) introduction section.

For a comprehensive overview of the Forc CLI commands, see the [Commands](./commands/index.md) section.
